# Hell-Week-Submission

Objective: To harness the power of machine learning to accurately predict the emotional turmoil status of individuals. 

Emotional turmoil is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, encompassing a range of emotional states and psychological well-being.

I am tasked with constructing a robust predictive model by analyzing a wide array of features, including physiological, behavioral, and contextual variables.

I have navigated through the dark depths of the dataset, extracting valuable insights and leveraged them to build a predictive model capable of capturing the nuances of emotional turmoil. 

The models have been created with the purpose of fulfilling the mentioned objective.
